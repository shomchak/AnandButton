This is an entertainment app with a focus on harrassing your friends. The first layer of the
app is a simple button that triggers the playback of an annoying laugh, a laugh originally
gifted to us by our dear friend Anand, and which is now fondly referred to as the Anand Noise.

The second (and slightly more sinister) layer of the app is the ability to remotely produce the 
Anand Noise on your friends phones (given that they have installed the app) from anywhere that 
you have cell service. At the push of a button you can cause your friends phone to erupt in a 
torrent of terrible Anand Noise, accompanied by a congratulatory toast "You suffer Anand!"

This app is still in development, though the core featrues have been tested and work nicely.
